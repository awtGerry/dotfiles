# Suckless software
I missed simplicity, sometimes i will use awesome, but
i think i'll stick with dwm most of the time

# DWM
Hands down my favorite wm, it has everything and it's fun
to customize.

# DWMBAR?
Still wandering about this one, may use another in the future.

# ST
Simple terminal is a great terminal, this is the one
i choose for my thinkpad.
